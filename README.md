# World Weather Analysis

The purpose of this project was to use the Open Weather Map and Google API's to assist customers in the planning of their vacations.
Through the work done, customers can input the ideal temperatures for their vacations.
Our program creates a list of cities that meet their ideal temperatures, and we were able to produce an itinerary of an example vacation.
The open weather map API allowed us to measure temperatures for cities to determine which cities were eligible.
The Google API let us locate hotels near these cities.
The Google API additionally allowed us to create driving routes to connect nearby cities for vacation planning.
The Google API can be used to also find walking and biking routes.
Lastly, the google API allowed us to create maps with markers that displayed the key information relative to each location in the planned vacation (i.e. hotel name, city).
Below is a picture showing an example vacation to four cities in Brazil, with markers providing information and driving routes connecting the cities.
